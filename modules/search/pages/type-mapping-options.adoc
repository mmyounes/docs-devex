:description: When you create a Search index in the {page-ui-name}, you must set options for each collection, object, Extended Attributes (XATTRs) object, or field mapping you add to your index. 

[abstract]
{description}

You can create the following types of mappings in the {page-ui-name}: 

* <<collection,>>
* <<object,>>
* <<xattrs,>>
* <<field,>>

TIP: Indexing an entire collection creates a dynamic type mapping for that collection. 
Indexing a field creates a static type mapping for the parent collection.
For more information about static and dynamic type mappings, see xref:customize-index.adoc#type-mappings[Search Index Features].

For more information about how to create a Search index, see xref:create-search-index-ui.adoc[]. 

[#collection]
== Collection Type Mapping Options 

Configure an entire collection type mapping to add or remove all documents in that collection from your Search index.

You can add <<object,JSON object mappings>>, an <<xattrs,Extended Attributes (XATTRs) mapping>>, or <<field,field type mappings>> for objects and fields inside your collection to change your collection type mapping from a xref:customize-index.adoc#dynamic[dynamic mapping] to a xref:customize-index.adoc#static[static mapping].

|====
|Option |Description 

| Index everything from collection: "`$COLLECTION_NAME`" 
a| You must select *Index everything from collection* to add a collection type mapping.

You can configure the following options for a JSON object mapping: 

|====
|Option |Description

| Index everything under: "`$OBJECT_NAME`" 
a| Select *Index everything under* to create a xref:customize-index.adoc#dynamic[dynamic] object mapping in your Search index.
